   abstract = {Leukocyte mRNA expression and plasma protein, metabolite, and lipid levels were measured in 102 COVID-19 and 26 non-COVID-19 patient samples. 219 diverse biomolecules were strongly associated with COVID-19 status and severity and pointed to dysregulation of processes related to lipid transport, blood coagulation, acute phase response, endotheliopathy, and neutrophil degranulation in this disease.},
